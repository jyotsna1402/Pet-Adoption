        <h3>Meet Brownie</h3>
        <p>Brownie has long, drooping ears with glossy golden fur on his body. He is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. We rescued him from a dog care centre in our neighbourhood when he was just a month old. He has a cute face with little paws and eyes and has a tiny tail. He is a healthy dog with a shiny coat.
